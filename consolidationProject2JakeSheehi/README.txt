~~~Tuple Out Dice Game~~~


~Description~

Tuple Out is a simple dice game where players take turns rolling dice and scoring points. The goal is to accumulate the most points or be the first to reach a target score. Be careful: if you roll the same value on all three dice, you'll "tuple out" and score zero for your turn!


~Rules~

On your turn, you roll three dice.
If all three dice show the same value, you "tuple out" and end your turn with 0 points.
If two of the dice show the same value, they become "fixed" and cannot be rerolled.
You can choose to reroll any unfixed dice as many times as you'd like, or choose to end your turn and score points.
Your score for the turn is the total value of all the dice.


~How to Play~

1. Run the Python script (tuple_out.py)
2. The game will ask you for the number of players and the target score.
3. Players will take turns rolling the dice according to the rules above.
4. The first player to reach or exceed the target score wins!


~Example~

You roll (3, 3, 5). The two "3"s are fixed.
You reroll the unfixed die and get a 1. Your total is now (3, 3, 1), so you score 7 points.
