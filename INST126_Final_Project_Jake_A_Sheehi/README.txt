I. How to Run the Program:
    1. Save and/or Copy the code as a Python file (i.e., explorationGame.py).
    2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
    3. Run the program using the python command followed by the filename. You can do this by typing "python escape_game.py" (without the quotation marks)

    1. The game will display introductory text and your current location.
    2. Read the descriptions of your surroundings.
    3. Look for available exits/path to go (i.e. north, south, east, or west).
    4. Type the direction you want to go and press Enter.
    5. If you encounter an enemy, a fight will begin. Choose to attack (Type the letter "a") or attempt to escape (Type the letter "r").

    7. Reaching the "Exit" room with at least 3 enemy kills allows you to escape the wasteland and win the game.
